## Getting Started

This version was created with Visual Studion 2022 (VS22).  It was compiled with the following properties:
  - Windows SDK Version: 10.0.xxxxx (latest)
  - Platfor Toolset: visual Studio 2022 (latest)
  - MFC: Use MFC in a Shared DLL
  - Character Set:  Use Unicode Character Set
  - Precompiled Header:  Not Using Precompiled Headers
  - Linker/Additional Dependencies:  Htmlhelp.lib

The HTML Help Workshop (HHW), Version 4.74.8702.0 (the last one produced) was used to prepare the help
file (WixApp.chm).  It is
copied into the Release directory.  I used Dreamweaver (DW) to do most of the content production of the
help files that the HTML Help Workshop produces (i.e. HHW is used to produce the pages/files needed
and DW is used to fill in the content).

Wix is used to create the &lt;AppName&gt;.msi file.  WixApp (one of my applications, see git) was used
to produce the product.wxs file.

Note:  In order to avoid hickups during the compilation/link process make sure the VS22 dependencies are
set so the projects are produced in the proper order.

## Prerequisites

Windows 7 or above.  visual Studio 2022 or above.  The WiX Toolset must be installed in Visual Studio.
The "HTML Help Workshop" (google it) must be installed on the PC.
